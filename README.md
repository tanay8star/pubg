# PUBG - A Data Science Perspective
This repository is my first fully fledged foray into the world of Data Science for my CZ1016 project. It delves into clustering and classification in order to enhance the matchmaking experience in the game, PlayerUnknown BattleGrounds. 

This dataset found from Kaggle, describes a wide variety of statistics from the popular video game. We began with an objective to classify these players into distinct categories and thus have a more motivated matchmaking experience to in the end, provide a better gamign experience.

We delved into the different types of clustering to evaluate which was the best for our given need, and then did some Principle Component Analysis to aid visualisation of the different dimensions, and we came up with some pretty interesting results.
